This is a skeleton data supply chain code written in Python for Tezos Project.
This works with Python 2.7 (and likely also Python 3)
This example is from the Transitions python package by Alexander Neumann and Tal Yarkoni.
Here is the original github repo: https://github.com/pytransitions/transitions
There is also a Web visualation of state machines that we should try to implement.
The associated repo is here: https://github.com/pytransitions/transitions-gui
